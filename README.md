# RRTstarSmart_FN

A combination between features of RRT*-Smart (J. Nasir, et al., 2013) and RRT*FN (O. Adiyatov, H. A. Varol, 2013) which is able to achieve the following key performances:
1. Shorter computational/completion time under same number of iterations
2. Retains its fast convergence rate to near-optimal solution
3. Memory-efficient in reducing memory space used

Codes are available in CPP and MATLAB.
